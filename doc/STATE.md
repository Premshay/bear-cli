# BEAR Session State

This file is the short operational handoff for the current work window.
For milestone status and backlog ordering, use `doc/PROGRAM_BOARD.md`.

## Last Updated

2026-02-19

## Current Focus

Product-development planning:
- active milestone is `P2`
- `bear fix` feature delivery is implemented and tests are passing
- release-evidence documentation is not a delivery gate for ongoing feature development

## Next Concrete Task

Define and execute next P2 feature:
1. Generated structural tests.

## Session Notes

- Created `doc/PROGRAM_BOARD.md` as the single live milestone/backlog board.
- Merged near-term and strategic roadmap content into `doc/ROADMAP.md`.
- Archived old `doc/ROADMAP_V0.md` snapshot at `doc/archive/ROADMAP_V0.md`.
- Moved historical state bulk to `doc/archive/STATE_HISTORY.md`.
- Added P1 preview-closure backlog item and normalized backlog metadata contract.
- Added interpretation guardrails to `doc/ROADMAP.md`, `doc/PROGRAM_BOARD.md`, and `doc/START_HERE.md` to separate feature scope from closure queue items.
- Added explicit Preview feature standing section in `doc/PROGRAM_BOARD.md` and aligned navigation docs to reference it.
- Rebased active planning to product-development-first flow and removed release-evidence gating from active queue.
- Implemented `bear fix` command (`single` + `--all`) with tests and synchronized agent-package/docs command surface.
